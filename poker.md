 about whether EUPL-1.1 is accurately described reminded me to file this enhancement idea.<br/><br/>For each license, license rules could be annotated with ranges of text in the license pertinent to the rule. Highlighting of ranges could be turned on/off on individual license pages by selecting in the license rules (permissions/conditions/limitations)

<br/><br/>Obviously this is not a big help for MIT, but for longer licenses, it can be tricky to figure out what bits of the license are pertinent for a particular rule, at least if you only want to read once, which is more already than I suspect most people do.<br/><br/>Such annotations  ]]></description></item><item>     <title>Add Free Art License</title>     <link>https://github.com/github/choosealicense.com/issues/314</link>    <description><![CDATA[ <a href="http://artlibre.org/licence/lal/en/)">Free Art License 1.3</a>

It could be great to get a report of all licenses checks in an XML formatted file; so we can process it using Jenkins plugins. For now, I have to analyse the `XXX dependencies checked, XXX warnings found.` string formatted output of `licensed status` command.<br/><br/>We can consider **licensed results** as **tests results**.<br/>* If all licenses check passed; then the overall test is **passed**.<br/>* If one license is found as unknown, or not matching any of allowed, ignored or reviewed configs; then the check/test **failed**.<br/><br/>Standards test output formats such as junit, nunit, mstest, google-test, etc. would be great cos already known by many CI tools. Junit is probably the most used one.<br/><br/>Organizing tests in \"groups\" matching the package type (npm, pip, go, etc.)
 and license type (mit, gpl...)
 would also allows to \"count\" the type of licenses found... providing some kind of statistics ^<br/><br/>Example of output in Jenkins test plugin results, processing the XML file could be:<br/>```<br/>Package                  Fail Skip Pass Total<br/>- total                     0    0   69    69<br/>- npm                       0    0   53    53<br/>  - mit                     0    0   45    45<br/>    - package1              0    0    1     1<br/>    - package 2             ...<br/>    - ...<br/>  - apache-2.0                              3<br/>    - package46<br/>    - ...<br/>  - bsd-3-clause                            1 <br/>    - package49<br/>  - isc                                     1<br/>    - package50<br/>  - unknown                                 3<br/>    - package51             1    0    0     1<br/>    - ...<br/>- go                                       16<br/>  - mit                                    14<br/>    - ...<br/>  - isc                                     1<br/>    - ...<br/>  - unknown                                 1<br/>    - packagexx             1    0    0     1<br/>    - ...<br/>```<br/>I did not fill the array; but you've got the point ;-)

. Right now weâ€™re an uneasy hybrid of `pathtype` solutions and `FilePath`; we should move off of the latter completely. This involves overhauling `Semantic.CLI` to use `pathtype`; the  <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pathtype-0.8.1)">documentation</a>
